# Getting Started with TDD in React

This is the companion repository for the Getting Started with TDD in React tutorial at [Semaphore CI](https://semaphoreci.com/).

Follow along with the tutorial for maximum benefit, and clone this repo to check your work.

To get started:

* `npm install`
* `npm install -g quik`
* `npm install -g mocha`

Then:

* `npm test` to run the tests
* `quik` to run the app

The commit history follows the flow of the tutorial. If you get stuck at any point, run `git log` and then `git checkout <hash>` the commit closest to where you are.
